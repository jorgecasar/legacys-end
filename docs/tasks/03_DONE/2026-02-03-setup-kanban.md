## Context & Goal
Establish a file-based Kanban system to provide long-term memory and context persistence for AI agents.

## Plan
- [x] Design the folder structure and task template
- [x] Create the directory structure in `docs/tasks/`
- [x] Create the `TEMPLATE.md` for new tasks
- [x] Create a `create-task` skill to standardize task creation
- [x] Add global rule to `docs/PROJECT_STANDARDS.md`
- [x] Create a `README.md` explaining how to use the system
- [x] Migrate active context (This file)

## Memory / Current State
I have completed the setup of the Kanban system.
1. Folders `00` to `04` created.
2. `TEMPLATE.md` and `README.md` created.
3. `create-task` skill implemented.
4. `PROJECT_STANDARDS.md` updated with Section 11.
5. `02_DOING` cleared and moved to history.

**Resolution**: Fully implemented and history consolidated.
