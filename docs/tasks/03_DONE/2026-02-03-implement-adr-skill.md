## Context & Goal
The user wants to implement an Architecture Decision Record (ADR) workflow, supported by an AI skill (`create-adr`) to standardize the creation of these records.

## Plan
- [x] Create `docs/adr/` directory
- [x] Create `docs/adr/TEMPLATE.md` (Standard Nygard format)
- [x] Create `docs/adr/README.md`
- [x] Create `.agent/skills/create-adr/SKILL.md`
- [x] Verify by creating the first ADR.

## Memory / Current State
I have fully implemented the ADR system.
1. Directory structure and templates are in place.
2. `create-adr` skill is functional.
3. First ADR (0001) is created.
4. Documentation added.

**Resolution**: Task completed. System ready for use.
