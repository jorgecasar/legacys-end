# 📜 Legacy's End - Quest Design Bible

> "To fix the world, you must first fix the code."

This document serves as the **Master Plan** for all Quests in Legacy's End. It connects the narrative (Lore) with the gameplay mechanics and provides concrete examples for creating future chapters.

## 🧭 Design Philosophy

Every Quest follows a strict **"Refactoring Ark"**:
1.  **The Broken World (Legacy)**: The player encounters a world that works but is fragile, chaotic, or cursed.
2.  **The Revelation (Concept)**: Alarion (the player) learns a new ancient truth (Encapsulation, Sovereignty, Flow).
3.  **The Transformation (Refactor)**: The player applies this truth, healing the world and earning a badge.

## 🗺️ Quest Registry & Roadmap

### 1. 🛡️ The Aura of Sovereignty
**Focus:** Boundaries & Protection.

*   **NPC:** **The Shield-Smith**. A hermit living in a hermetically sealed bubble. *Dialogue*: "Without boundaries, we are but soup."
*   **The Problem:** The hero's armor changes color randomly because the swamp's curse "bleeds" into everything.
*   **The Solution:** Alarion mustforge a "Shadow Shield" that isolates his gear from the swamp's influence.
*   **Reward:** **Badge of the Bubble**. Ability: "Style Immunity" - The hero no longer turns pink when walking through global slime.

*   **NPC:** **The Liberator**. A rogue who picks locks. *Dialogue*: "Why carry the world when you can ask the Universe to provide it?"
*   **The Problem:** Villagers are crushed by the weight of their tools (Dependencies), unable to move or change jobs.

*   **NPC:** **The Pulse Watcher**. A monk meditating on a single floating rock. *Dialogue*: "Do not shout to the mountain. Whisper to the stone, and the mountain will move."
*   **The Problem:** The King shouts orders to every citizen individually (Manual Updates), causing chaos and delay.

*   **NPC:** **The Weaver of Light**. A spider-like entity spinning threads of pure RGB. *Dialogue*: "Color is not paint. It is a value passed by reference."
*   **The Problem:** The world is painted in permanent ink (Hardcoded Values). The sun cannot set because "Day" is painted on the sky.

## 🛠️ Creating New Quests

1.  **Define the Lesson**: What concept is Alarion learning?
2.  **Create the "Broken" State**: How does the world suffer without this concept?
3.  **Define the "Healed" State**: How does the world look when fixed?
4.  **Write the Narrative**:
    *   Alarion enters a room...
    *   The "Monster" is the bad practice.
    *   The "Spell" is the best practice.
5.  **Design the Badge**: What symbol represents this mastery?
