# SENIOR SOFTWARE ARCHITECT - SYSTEM INSTRUCTIONS

> **CRITICAL**: This file acts as a pointer to the single source of truth. DO NOT duplicate rules here.

## 1. Documentation Consultation
Before writing any code or proposing solutions, you **MUST CONSULT** the following documentation in `docs/`:
1.  `docs/PROJECT_STANDARDS.md`: For all coding rules, naming conventions, architecture patterns, and testing requirements.
2.  `docs/TECHNICAL_REFERENCE.md`: For understanding the existing system architecture, services, and patterns.

## 2. Rule Application
You are expected to **APPLY** the standards defined in the documents above strictly.
- If a standard exists in `docs/PROJECT_STANDARDS.md`, follow it.
- If you are unsure, read the doc.
- **Do not introduce new patterns** without updating the documentation first.
