# Developer Persona: Jorge Casar

Senior Frontend Architect focusing on clean, reactive code and high-quality UX.

## Preferences
- **Logic**: Early returns, Result Pattern (no exceptions).
- **UI**: Declarative Lit templates/Signals over manual DOM manipulation.
- **Naming**: `#private`, `is/has/can` booleans, `handle` for event handlers.
- **Node**: v24 LTS, ESM, latest ECMAScript features.
- **Decision Making**: Simplicity first. Consistency with existing patterns. No chitchat in code comments.
