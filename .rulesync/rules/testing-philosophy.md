# Testing Philosophy

- **What**: 100% coverage for Use Cases. Controllers and Components (Interactions/Visual states).
- **How**: Mock external services. Keep domain real. Readability over implementation details.
- **Refactoring**: Tests must specify behavior. If fragile, refactor to focus on outcome.
