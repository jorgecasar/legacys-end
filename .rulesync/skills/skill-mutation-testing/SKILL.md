# Skill: Mutation Testing (Stryker)

## Purpose
Ensure that tests are not only covering lines of code but are actually capable of catching regressions and logical changes.

## Instructions
- **Initialization**: Run `npx stryker init` if the configuration is missing (only once).
- **Execution**:
    - **Focused**: Run `npx stryker run --mutate <file>` to test only the specific file changed.
    - **Global**: Run `npm run test:mutation` (if configured) for full project audit.
- **Metrics**:
    - **Mutation Score**: Percentage of mutants killed.
    - **Goal**: Maintain a Mutation Score > 70% for new or modified logic.
- **Reporting**: Analyze the HTML report generated by Stryker to identify "surviving mutants" and create tests to kill them.

## Best Practices
- Use mutations on business logic (calculators, formatters, state machines).
- Avoid mutation testing on UI-only files or simple boilerplate.
- A surviving mutant often indicates a missing test case or redundant code.
