# Legacy's End

**Legacy's End** is an RPG adventure where you step into the boots of **Alarion**, a legendary developer summoned to save a digital world crumbling under the weight of "Legacy Code".

You must travel through these lands, learn the ancient arts of **Refactoring**, and heal the source code of reality itself.

## 🛠️ Development & AI Automation

This project follows a clean architectural pattern and utilizes AI-driven development:

- **Architecture**: Separated into Domain (Use Cases), Infrastructure (Services), and UI (Lit Components).
- **Task Management**: We use a file-based Kanban system in `docs/tasks/`.
- **AI Agent**: You can automate task resolution by creating a GitHub Issue with the label `ai-agent`. The project will automatically trigger a workflow to solve the task and open a PR. See [AI Agent Workflow](docs/AI_AGENT_WORKFLOW.md) for details.
