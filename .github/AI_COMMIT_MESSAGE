feat(arch): implement use cases layer and refactor progress logic

This commit introduces the Use Cases layer to the application architecture, creating a separation
between orchestration and domain logic.

The `progress-service` was refactored, extracting complex orchestration logic into two new use
cases: `evaluate-chapter-transition` and `unlock-new-quests`. This makes the `progress-service` a
more focused state management service.

The `QuestController` was updated to use the new `evaluateChapterTransition` use case, simplifying
its `completeChapter` method. All related tests were updated to reflect these changes, and new
tests were added for the use cases.

This change improves the maintainability and testability of the quest progression system by
adhering to clean architecture principles.

Fixes #383
